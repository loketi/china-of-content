      <p>Weight is one of the most important
        health concerns people face today. Most of
        us have heard the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html"
          target="_blank">CDC’s warnings</a> that
        several common causes of early death, such
        as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes,
        and even certain types of cancer are
        linked to obesity. While weight management
        involves a whole lifestyle of good habits,
        one integral piece is weighing yourself.
        You need a bathroom scale.</p>

        one that’s wirelessly connected to an app

        potential to make your whole family
        happier about doing it.</p>
      <h2 id="what-is-a-smart-scale">What Is a
        Smart Scale?</h2>
      <p>A smart body scale is an electronic
        bathroom scale that measures weight and
        other body composition metrics, and then
        sends them wirelessly to an app or online
        service that automatically records the
        data.</p>
      <p>Those other metrics generally include
        body fat, body water, and often body mass
        index (BMI). Some of the metrics are
        readings while others, like BMI, are
        estimates based on calculations that take
        into consideration height and sex, too.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A smart scale costs anywhere from about
        $30 to $100. You don’t have to buy the
        most expensive model to get something
        good. Getfitech Blog’s favorite smart

        that, and it’s a decent model. It does,
        however, lack a pregnancy mode, which is a
        cool smart scale feature (as I’ll
        explain), but one that may or may not
        matter to you personally.</p>
      <h2 id="what-do-smart-scales-do">What Do
        Smart Scales Do?</h2>
      <p>The primary job of a smart scale is to
        record your weight and other metrics in an
        app that lets you see your history of
        weight change over time.</p>
      <p>Multiple people can use the same scale,
        making them perfect for a health-conscious
        family. Most scales differentiate each
        person based on their prior readings. If
        one family members weighs around 160
        pounds and the other weighs 140, the scale
        quickly figures out who is who. If two
        people have close readings, the scale or
        app usually asks the person being weighed
        at the moment to confirm his or her
        identity. It’s usually as simple as
        lifting one foot slightly off the scale to
        say yes or no, that is or isn’t me.</p>
      <p>A smart scale helps a family organize
        their health initiatives because it makes
        the tracking effortless. No one ever has
        to write down the details of the weigh-in
        because the tracking happens
        automatically. The most you have to do is
        make sure the scale’s batteries are still
        going strong.</p>
      <p>Recording all the weigh-ins automatically
        is a huge benefit to everyone in the
        household for reviewing weight history.
        But it can also be extremely helpful to a
        family physician or other health care
        provider who might want to see your
        family’s weight trends, too. If someone in
        your family suddenly gets ill and the
        doctor asks if there have been any drastic
        changes in weight, you’ll be able to tell.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>What Are the Benefits of Using a Smart
        Scale?</h2>
      <p>Beyond tracking weight, there are other
        benefits to using a smart scale:</p>
      <h3 id="you-dont-have-to-look">1. You don’t
        have to look!</h3>
      <p>Like I said before, stepping on the scale
        sometimes sucks. When you use a smart
        scale, you don’t have to look if you don’t
        want to. The weight will still be recorded
        in your app, and you or your doctor can
        look later. Long-term trends are at least
        as important as the daily numbers.</p>
      <h3 id="pregnancy-and-post-pregnancy-weight-tracking-is-much-easier.">2.
        Pregnancy and post-pregnancy
        weight-tracking is much easier.</h3>
      <p>A lot of people don’t like facing the
        numbers of their weight, but imagine how
        much worse it could be if your body’s
        hormones are fluctuating during or after a
        pregnancy. One of my favorite smart
        scales, the Xiaomi bluetooth 4.0 LED Smart
        Scale, has a pregnancy mode that hides
        your weight from appearing on the scale
        while still recording it in the app. This
        mode also disables the body composition
        features, which pregnant women (as well as
        people with implanted devices, such as
        pacemakers) are often told not to use.</p>
      <h3 id="smart-scales-can-increase-motivation.">3.
        Smart scales can increase motivation.</h3>
      <p>If you and your family like technology,
        incorporating a smart scale might actually
        make it fun to start tracking weight, or
        at least motivate them to start. Having a
        new toy in the house could give everyone
        the boost they need to start stepping on
        the scale every day.</p>
      <h3 id="kids-can-learn-good-habits.">4. Kids
        can learn good habits.</h3>
      <p>If everyone steps on the scale every day,
        and there’s a record to prove it, kids
        will pick up on what it means to create a
        habit out of their weight-management
        practices, and creating good habits is
        key.</p>
      <h3 id="they-typically-pair-with-fitness-trackers.">5.
        They typically pair with fitness trackers.</h3>
      <p>If you already use a <strong>fitness
          tracker</strong>, buying the companion
        smart scale will give you much more
        insight into how your activities, sleep,
        and food intake affect your weight.
        Currently, there are scales that work with
        trackers made by Fitbit, Xiaomi, Garmin,
        Polar, Withings, and Nuyu.</p>
      <h2 id="get-smart">Get Smart</h2>
      <p style="height: 3px;">Adding a smart scale
        to your own or your family’s
        weight-management plan could help give
        everyone the boost they need to get those
        daily weigh-ins done. Developing positive
        daily habits is hard, but it’s a little
        easier when you have a new device to play
        with while doing it.</p>
